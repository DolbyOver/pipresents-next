Version 1.2.1 beta 1

MPlayer must now be installed before using Pi Presents - sudo apt-get install mplayer

This version has many new fields so the version number has increased from 1.1 to 1.2
* This version of Pi Presents will not run shows prepared under previous versions of pp_editor
* Using the editor on a previous version of a profile will automatically upgrade the profile to the current version HOWEVER SEE BELOW!!!
* There is one change you might have to do manually. If you used PIR as the trigger for a mediashow change the 'Start Trigger' field to GPIO and enter PIR into the 'trigger input' field.

There is a simplified way to do fullscreen so the --fullscreen (-f) command option now has no parameters. Also there is no need to edit the lxde-rc.xml file or change the taskbar to autohide. However if lxde-rc.xml is already edited just leave it it will not affect operation.

The Version 1.1.x examples use omxplayer to play audio tracks. MPlayer can now be used. To do this in this beta you will need to delete the track and re-create it.

In version 1.1.x at the end of a mediashow the screen went blank, this does not happen in version 1.2.1 as, in order to reduce the flicker between tracks I leave the previous track on display while displaying the next. You will need to add a 1 second blank message track if you want a blank screen. 

This and future versions can potentially blow up your Pi as it controls the digital outputs. Until you are familiar with it I suggest ensuring all GPIO pins are disconnected when using Pi Presents.

Enjoy, feedback welcome.


Version 1.1.2
On a Windows PC the editor did not reliably save medialists. I have added a workaround which asks the user to re-try  the save it seems to always work on the second or third time.

unclutter must be installed before using Pi Presents  (sudo apt-get install unclutter)

In my tests liveshow coped well with deleting tracks at any time. However I can see there are potential problems as files could be deleted at the moment they are being read. If you have problems please report them and I will improve the mutual exclusion.
